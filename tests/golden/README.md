# Golden tests

Each test is a small Pascal file, `tests/golden/<area>/<name>.pas`, next to
the assembly the compiler is expected to produce, `<name>.s`.  The expected
`.s` is normalised: no comments, canonical spacing.

- There is one test per pattern in `docs/codegen-patterns.md`.  The `.pas`
  header comment names the pattern's section and the image address it
  mirrors.
- A change to an expected `.s` needs a reason in the commit message.

See CLAUDE.md section 6, item 2.

The runner is `crates/dpc/tests/golden.rs` (part of `cargo test` /
`make test`).  It compiles each `.pas` with the `dpc` binary and compares
the normalised output: `|` comments removed, lines trimmed, runs of blanks
collapsed to one space, empty lines dropped.  `DPC_BLESS=1 cargo test
--test golden` rewrites the expected files from the compiler's output.

Tests:

- `sets/in_long_set` - codegen-patterns 5.1, 3, 2: PROC1_$TST_LOCK
  0xE148CA.
