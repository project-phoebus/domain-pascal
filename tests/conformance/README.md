# Image conformance tests

This is the main gate (CLAUDE.md section 6, item 3).  Each test is a Pascal
version of a real routine from the SR10.2 SAU2 kernel.  The harness:

1. compiles and assembles it;
2. links it standalone at the routine's image address;
3. compares the bytes with the image.

Relocations are matched symbolically, as `../source`'s `asm_compare.py`
does.  The harness keeps a table of external symbols and their image
addresses, taken from the SAU2 link map.

The first candidates are listed in CLAUDE.md section 6 (PROC1_$TST_LOCK,
TIME_$Q_INIT_QUEUE, PROC1_$GET_LOADAV, AST_$PAGE_ZERO, LOG_$READ).  No tests
yet.
